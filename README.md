# CMPM 121 D3 Project

Players explore a real-world map made of latitude–longitude grid cells.\
Each cell may contain a digital “token” with a certain value.\
Players can collect nearby tokens, combine tokens of the same value to craft higher-value ones, and aim to create the highest-value token possible.
